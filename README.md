## 2.Workflow

### Github
We were with a group of three (Maryame, Santiago, Nathan). We divided some work, but stayed connected through discord to help each other. We worked in separate branches and at the end tried to merge everything. We encountered some problems with the merges, but resolved them by adjusting the JSON files that represented the notebook. Small changes for instance the README or some spellings mistakes were directly made on the main branch. 

## 3.Summary

This notebook contains 4 charts that visualizes correlations between happiness, life expectancy and other parameters of countries. The communication took place in Discord and Github was used to make one notebook together.

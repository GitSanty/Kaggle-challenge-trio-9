# Kaggle-challenge-trio-9

## 1.Summary

Dataset: <https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report?select=2020.csv>
This notebook contains 4 charts that visualizes correlations between happiness, life expectancy and other parameters of countries. The communication took place in Discord and Github was used to make one notebook together.

## 2.Results

### The chosen dataset: 
_2020.csv_: this dataset has information about the happiness of the people all around the world with some extra information like freedom, GDP, life expectancy...

### Plot#1
Scatter plot with on the x-axis the GDP of the country and on the y-axis the happiness ladder score. The general trend says that the higher the GDP of a country, the happier the population in general.\

### plot#4
A scatter plot that has the social support of a country on the x-axis and the life expectancy on the y-axis. It also has a trendline that shows that the more social support a country has the long the population stays healthy and alive.\

### plot#5
Finally Santiago practiced some more and added a heatmap with another dataset: "flights". A heatmap was generated that shows how many passengers took a flight in a certain month. On the x-axis are years so we can see a clear evolution and we can also see that the summer months are the most popular time of the year to fly somewhere.\

## 3.Workflow

### Github
We are a group of three (Maryame, Santiago, Nathan). We divided some work, but stayed connected through discord to help each other. We worked in separate branches and at the end tried to merge everything. We encountered some problems with the merges, but resolved them by adjusting the JSON files that represented the notebook. Small changes for instance the README or some spellings mistakes were directly made on the main branch.
